# Transfer-Learning-VGG16---Landscape-Recognition

The dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshsaxenadn/landscape-recognition-image-dataset-12k-images/data

For this project, I will only use the Coast and Desert categories, with a total of 5,000 images. Transfer learning will be applied using the VGG16 model to classify each category.
